<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Currently pursuing B.Tech in Computer Engineering at Fr. Conceiao Rodrigues Institue of Technology, Vashi.
  I'm a curious and dedicated learner currently pursuing Computer Engineering.
  Passionate about problem-solving and systems programming, I enjoy exploring the intersection of low-level code and creative applications. </p>

<p>I'm a student who's always been fascinated by how things work—especially in tech.
  Whether it's reverse engineering, writing linked list games in C, or solving puzzles at 3AM, I love getting hands-on and figuring things out.
  When I’m not coding, you’ll find me gaming or just chilling with late-night thoughts.</p>

<p>Computer engineering nerd with a soft spot for C, terminal games, and cool bugs (the programming kind, mostly).
   I break stuff just to fix it better. Catch me awake at weird hours, learning, playing, or dreaming up my next side project.</p>

<h1>The Best Movies According to Edwin</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movie List</h2>
<hr />
<ol>
<li><h3>Vertigo</h3>
<p>Really great movie. It not only revolved around solving the case, but the protagonist came over his fear of "vertigo".</p>

<li><h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
<p>Nolan most profoundly and amazingly portrayed Christian Bale as the Batman and also did not fail to show the craziness of Joker through Heath Ledger.</p>

<li><h3>Pulp Fiction</h3>
<p>Pulp Fiction is that wild, quotable ride where every scene feels iconic no matter how many times you watch it.</p>
